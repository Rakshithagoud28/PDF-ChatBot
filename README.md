# PDF-ChatBot

Project Overview
Intelligent Document-based Chatbot is a powerful AI-driven chatbot that leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide accurate answers based on the contents of PDF files. Users can upload their documents, ask any question, and the chatbot will extract relevant information in real-time, delivering context-aware responses.

The system integrates:

1)FAISS for high-performance vector similarity search, enabling rapid retrieval of relevant content.
2)Groq for efficient large language model processing, ensuring fast and accurate question answering.
3)Streamlit for an intuitive, user-friendly interface that simplifies interactions.

The chatbot focuses only on the PDF you upload, so it’s great for:
-Answering questions about company documents, manuals, or training materials.
-Quickly finding answers in long documents without reading everything.
-It won’t give unrelated answers because it only knows what’s in the uploaded file.

This project bridges the gap between static documents and dynamic, real-time query responses, making data from PDF files easily accessible and actionable.
