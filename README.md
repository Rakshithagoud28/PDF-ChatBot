Project Overview<br>
Intelligent Document-based Chatbot is a powerful AI-driven chatbot that leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide accurate answers based on the contents of PDF files. Users can upload their documents, ask any question, and the chatbot will extract relevant information in real-time, delivering context-aware responses.

The system integrates:

 
1)FAISS for high-performance vector similarity search, enabling rapid retrieval of relevant content.<br>
2)Groq for efficient large language model processing, ensuring fast and accurate question answering.<br>
3)Streamlit for an intuitive, user-friendly interface that simplifies interactions.<br>

The chatbot focuses only on the PDF you upload, so it’s great for:<br>
-Answering questions about company documents, manuals, or training materials.<br>
-Quickly finding answers in long documents without reading everything.<br>
-It won’t give unrelated answers because it only knows what’s in the uploaded file.<br>

This project bridges the gap between static documents and dynamic, real-time query responses, making data from PDF files easily accessible and actionable.
